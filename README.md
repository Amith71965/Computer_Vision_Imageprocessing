# Computer_Vision_Imageprocessing

Written a Python code for histogram equalization of any grayscale image. I took a greyscale image having low contrast of my choice and performed a Histogram equalization

I have used OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to perform histogram equalization and plot the original and equalized images along with their histograms.
